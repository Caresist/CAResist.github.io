        <p class="SpiralFont3"> Spiral is me. I currently am using this site to use as a base to practice simple code, as I learn in a practical sense much better than I do from doing straight forward lessons. Don't mind things breaking. My YouTube channel is by far the least successful, and I as a person am the least popular. I do a lotta music stuff, and fill the rest of that time with gaming and watching vids/anime. Check out my music on SoundCloud if you want, I wouldn't mind some tips on how to actually music.</p>
        <p class="SpiralFont3">Also I like space pictures it's pretty artsy that's why everything is either edgy graphic design or space over here.</p>
